# Welcome to Biohaskell!

Here you can find information on using the [Haskell](http://haskell.org/) programming language to solve bioinformatics problems.


There is a [Bioinformatics](http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/pkg-list.html#cat:Bioinformatics) section on HackageDB, containing various bioinformatics [programs](https://github.com/BioHaskell/biohaskell.github.io/wiki/Applications) and [libraries](https://github.com/BioHaskell/biohaskell.github.io/wiki/Libraries) written in Haskell.

# What is Haskell?

[Haskell](http://haskell.org) is a modern, functional programming language with an advanced type system and non-strict semantics.  If you are used to programming in imperative languages, you will find Haskell offers very different approaches to developing software.  Try it!

# What is Bioinformatics?

Bioinformatics is the branch of computer science that deals with biological data, mainly on the molecular level.  Current advances in biology has
led to tremendous amounts of data on genes and genomes, proteins, and complex interaction.  The field spans from databases to visualization to algorithms for analysis.

# What is Biohaskell?

Biohaskell - the name, the mailing list, the logo, this wiki - is intended as an umbrella for software that is implemented in Haskell for working with biological data.
If you are developing software that fits the bill, you are by definition a Biohaskell developer, and encouraged to make use of those resources, and in particular, to subscribe to the mailing list.  Welcome!

# History

This special interest group was originally managed by Ketil Malde as a [wiki](https://github.com/BioHaskell/biohaskell.github.io/wiki/)
and has since be moved to GitHub.

Former _biohaskell@biohaskell.org_ mailing list is no longer active.
We suggest that you talk with us on Gitter or file issue here.

Information about **Google summer of code** project could be a good way to get involved, more information is [here](https://github.com/BioHaskell/biohaskell.github.io/wiki/Google_Summer_of_Code).
